###1. Overview of the user guide
======

 * #####Purpose of the user guide.

  This user guide is intended to explain the features of (Web Document Management System) WDMS and show how to use them, in a manner the typical user would comprehend. 

 * #####Convention in this user guide

  The user guide can be read through like a tutorial, or it can be used as a reference material to look up a specific function or set of functions.

 * #####Recommended reading.

  If at any point you don’t understand the terms used in this document look to section 2.3 (Terminology used in the system), which explains terms used.  If you are unable to follow the directions, we suggest that you read “The Internet for Dummies” [1] which is a good starting point for someone with little to no internet experience.


###2. Overview of the system
======

 * #####Why use the system?

  This system provides a simple way to manage and collaborate by sharing documents between employees (and guests) within a single organization.  This system centralizes document management and ensures that documents are stored in a secure manner.

 * #####Introduction to the system

The WDMS (Web Document Management System) is a website which can be accessed over the internet from any location, and at any time of the day or night.  The system (WDMS) will hold your documents, and allow you to share these documents with others including responsible department managers and corporate level users.  To use this system you must first have a computer with access to the internet.  If you are working with large documents, it is recommended that you use a good internet connection, or performance may be degraded.

 * #####Terminology used in the system

  WDMS – Web Document Management System
  This is the system which this user guide is introducing you to.
  
 * #####Accessing the website

 The first thing we must do is access the website.  To so this open your web-browser (Internet Explorer or FireFox or Chrome, etc.) and type into your address bar the following ‘https://10.0.2.111’.  The website should appear with a welcome screen for the WDMS.  If you don’t see the website refer to section B of the appendix under ‘Trouble-shooting and limitations’.
 
 ###3. Creating a new account
======

 * #####Finding the account creation page

  Now that you have accessed the website, we will need to get some details form you in order to create your account.  On the webpage you will notice that in the upper right hand of the screen there is a button labeled “Log in”.  Click this button once.  Two new options have appeared, one is to log-in to an existing account, and the second is to create a new account.  Click the button “create a new account”.

 * #####Filling in account details & requesting permissions

 At this point you are asked for your email address.  This is the email address which you will use the log-in to the system in the future.  You are asked to create a password which conforms to the password policy. Password should be alplhanumeric. It must contain 8-16 characters, with no whitespaces, and at least 1 lowercase & 1 upper case & 1 non-alphanumeric characters.  A third option is also present which asks what your role is in the organization.    This is necessary so that we can assign you the proper rights and permissions as designated by your role. Also the department to which the user belongs is selected from the drop downlist. Finally the captcha needs to be entered.  When you have finished entering all your data, click the button at the bottom of the page labeled “Create my account”.  This will send your request to the administrator who will approve or deny it as soon as possible.  For now you must wait until your account has been approved before you can do anything.
